A mind map is a diagram used to view, classify and
organize concepts, and to generate new ideas. It is used to
connect words, ideas and concepts to a central idea or concept

Mind Mapping is a technique used to record ideas and organize information either of an individual or a group of people. Mind mapping attempts to break linear thinking patterns by organizing information and pictures in clusters of branches from a central topic. The diagram can be used at any time during an initiative but is commonly used extensively during the early phases when lots of exploration of ideas is being conducted.
