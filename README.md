# Enterprise-Architecture-Modelling-with-Sparx---Conceptual-Model-Designs-with-Mind-Maps

#### Conceptual Enterprise Models
These models are constructed at a high level of abstraction. Discussion at this enterprise architecture modelling stage always involves the high level hierarchies of the business; i.e the stakeholders and emterprise data architects. System constraints are often not taken into account during this stage. The enterprise architects along with the business stakeholders will specify and define the needs of the organization in a broad sense. The architects will then organize the information needed to develop a system that can be used (in a broad sense) to solve the problem. 

Mind maps diagrams such as shown below may be used to record the inputs from several stakeholders and the architects at this stage.

#### Logical Enterprise Models
At this stage, business stakeholders, along with the enterprise architects will specify the limitations of the crrent business technologies. The types, attributes and relationships of the entities that will inhabit the system being designed will be specified. The overarching objective is to develop a platform independent representation of the entities and their relationships.

#### Physical Physical Models
At this stage of the enterprise architecture definition, questions regarding how to implement the logical models are answered. The database types, software and hardware types, timelines inputs, output(s) and how to solve the problems specified in the conceptual and logical layers  are discussed


##### Conceptual Data Models with Mind Maps
A mind map is a diagram used to view, classify and
organize concepts, and to generate new ideas. It is used to
connect words, ideas and concepts to a central idea or concept

Mind Mapping is a technique used to record ideas and organize information either of an individual or a group of people. Mind mapping attempts to break linear thinking patterns by organizing information and pictures in clusters of branches from a central topic. The diagram can be used at any time during an initiative but is commonly used extensively during the early phases when lots of exploration of ideas is being conducted.
