# Enterprise Architecture Modelling with Sparx: Conceptual Model Designs with Mind Maps
In this discourse, the stages of enterprise achitecture and data modeling are briefly discussed. The uses of mind maps in all the stages are discussed. Also shown are examples regarding how mind maps are designed using a trial version of the Sparx Enteprise Architecture Modeling software.

### Conceptual Enterprise Data Models
These models are constructed at a high level of abstraction. Discussion at this enterprise architecture modelling stage always involves the high level hierarchies of the business; i.e the stakeholders and emterprise data architects. System constraints are often not taken into account during this stage. The enterprise architects along with the business stakeholders will specify and define the needs of the organization in a broad sense. The architects will then organize the information needed to develop a system that can be used (in a broad sense) to solve the problem. 

Mind maps diagrams such as shown below may be used to record the inputs from several stakeholders and the architects at this stage.

###### Brief Discourse on Mind Maps
A mind map is a diagram used to record, view, classify and organize concepts, and to generate new ideas. It is used to connects shared thoughts, ideas, words and concepts to a central idea or business concept. Mind Mapping is a technique used to record ideas and organize information either of an individual or a group of people. Mind mapping attempts to break linear thinking patterns by organizing ideas, concepts and information in clusters of logical branches around a central topic. The diagram can be used at any time during all stages of the enterprise architecture modeling but is commonly used extensively during the early phases when lots of exploration of ideas is being conducted.

### Logical Enterprise Data Models
At this stage, business stakeholders, along with the enterprise architects will specify the limitations of the current business technologies. The types, attributes and relationships of the entities that will inhabit the system being designed will be specified. The overarching objective is to develop a platform independent representation of the entities and their relationships.
---
A model such as shown below will be used at this stage. The model below was produced using Sparx Enterprise Architect software.

###### Sparx Enterprise Architecture Modelling Software
Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect software is a visual modeling and design tool based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language). The platform supports: the design and construction of enterprise data architecture, enterprise software systems, modeling business processes, and modeling industry based domains. It is used by businesses and organizations to not only model the architecture of their systems, but to process the implementation of these models across the full application development life-cycle.
---
### Physical Physical Data Models
At this stage of the enterprise architecture definition, questions regarding how to implement the logical models are answered. The database types, software and hardware types, timelines inputs, output(s) and how to solve the problems specified in the conceptual and logical layers  are discussed. In many instances, the physical model always mirrors the logical model. UML  diagrams may be used at this stage. Some UML software such as LucidChart could be used to convert the UML-based physical model into a software such as mermaid code and/or SQL codes.

##### Enterprise Architecture Modeling with Sparx - An Example
Here, an example is shown regarding how to use mind maps to record the details of the conceptual stage of the enterprise architecture modeling. A trial version of the Sparx Enterprise Architecture software is used to show how mind maps can be designed to record the conceptual stage of the enterprise architecture modeling.

###### After installing the Sparx Enterprise Architecture Modeling sofware, go to design and then select 'Model Builder' under the 'Create' category (Fig. 1 & Fig. 2 below)....

###### Select the basic Mind Map category (Fig. 3 below)

###### Select Mind Mapping Diagram template (Fig. 4 )

The template is a great way to start recording ideas that are generated during the conceptual phase of the enterprise architecture modeling discussion. The template can be edited to record the ongoing ideas/concepts/relatonships of the ongoing conceptual architecture modeling discussion (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 below).

###### The mind map can also be designed from ground up without using the template as shown in Fig. 7 below

###### By using the ground-up mind mapping design approach (without using a teplate), in Fig 8 - Fig 10 (below), a conceptual model of the stages involved in designning a fictitious bridge (LakenHouse Bridge) are shown. The interaction between the stages are shown with relationship (association) links. In subsequent discourses, the logical and physical models of the LakenHouse Bridge design using the Sparx Enterprise Architecture Modeling software will be discussed.
